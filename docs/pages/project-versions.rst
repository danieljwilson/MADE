The current iterations of the project include:

---
v1
---

Description
-----------
- 1,2,3 multipliers

Goal
-----
- Disambuguate atribute weights from attribute evaluation
- Test whether value and weighting affect subject attention

---
v2
---

Description
-----------
- Additional multipliers (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)

Goal
-----
- Test response to fractional weights
- Calculate subjects' weighting curve to wider range of weights

------
v3.0.1
------

Description
-----------
- Both multipliers onscreen simultaneously (0.1, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)

Goal
-----
- Test whether subjects bias their first/total
  fixation to the higher multiplier

------
v3.0.2
------

Description
-----------
- Accuracy incentive
- Both multipliers onscreen simultaneously (0.1, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)


Goal
-----
- Test whether subjects try harder with an accuracy incentive,
  rather than a cumulative payoff

    * This avoids the most difficult trials having the lowest value/cost

------
v3.1.0
------

Description
-----------

- Time pressure (low)
- Accuracy incentive
- Both multipliers onscreen simultaneously (0.1, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)


Goal
-----
- Test whether time pressure increases the likelihood of biasing
  first fixation toward the higher weighted stimulus

------
v3.1.1
------

Description
-----------

- Time pressure (low/high/no)
- Accuracy incentive
- Both multipliers onscreen simultaneously (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)

Goal
-----
- Test whether time pressure increases the likelihood of biasing
  first fixation toward the higher weighted stimulus under three conditions.

------
v3.2.0
------

Description
-----------

- Full choice (multipliers and images)
- Accuracy incentive
- (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)

Goal
-----
- Test whether a stimulus (base value) or multiplier (weight)
  bias exists.

------
v3.3.0
------

Description
-----------

- Bias test: Attractiveness
- Accuracy incentive
- (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 10)

Goal
-----
- Test whether subjects overweight attractive vs. unattractive
  faces
