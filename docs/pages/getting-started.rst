Getting Started
===============

This documentation will cover some of the basics of the project,
and hopefully put you in a position to run the
experiment and analyze data yourself.

----------------------
Running the Experiment
----------------------

The experiment runs using Psychopy 3.1.

The experiment protocol can be found on Dropbox at
``DJW_Projects/01_MADE/PAPERWORK/MADE_v3_Protocol.gdoc``

The questionnaire is hosted on Qualtrix.
Contact daniel.j.wilson@gmail.com for login information.

Re: Dropbox
----------------------
Due to Dropbox issues the current process is:

- Download the latest experiment from GitHub
- Run locally (files are stored in ``subject_data``)
- Upload local subject files to Dropbox at EOD
